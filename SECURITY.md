# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version of the library will contain all supported security updates at any given time. We are unable
to go back and re-release previous library versions with security patches, and instead will create a new library
release for any discovered security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you detect a security vulnerability, please draft a new private security advisory using the
[Security](https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm/security/advisories) button at the top of this repository.
This will notify the developers, who will make the security vulnerability public and seek to find a solution to the problem.
